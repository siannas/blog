I did this after realizing that the game industry is currently having significant growth and I myself do not only like to play but also enjoy developing games. That is why I like to dive into this industry."),n.createElement("p",null,"Together with my friends, we founded the uniXcorp Studio. This team has been doing several B2B projects and participated in competitions and exhibitions. The most memorable ones such as passing the curation of Baparekraf Game Prime 2021 (08/2021), Best Audio in Indie game Ignite Compfest 12, University of Indonesia (09/2020), and took 2nd place in Cipta Game Vocational Training Education by Indonesia Ministry of Manpower (07/2022).

There, I got a lot of new knowledge, not only about programming but also about game design, product management, emotional intelligence, and resource management. The game we made was titled Heisters: heister vs heister. Moreover, we have relations with other Game Developer studios."),n.createElement("p",null,"I'm used to working on the backend in game development. Love to use the Model-Controller principle to separate data from the logic controller hence the program is easier to maintain. Even so, I also learned about 3D modeling and animation to make it easier for me to work on 3D games. I'm also learning HLSL shader programming in Unity which turn the games more interesting with manipulative visuals."),n.createElement("p",null,"I personally feel that I have the urge to learn a lot from experienced studios in the game industry. I hope that in the future I can be involved in several game projects with great game studios out there.
